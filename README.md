# Workspace Sidebar

**(vsc-workspace-sidebar)**

Adds a sidebar to VSCode that lists Workspaces and lets you open them in the current window or a new window. The results are cached for 12 Hours but there is a refresh button that you can click to refind workspaces at any time. Workspaces can also be sorted ascending or descending and the currently loaded workspace is highlighted with a check mark.
